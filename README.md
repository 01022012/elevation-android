## Yo Elevation

Utility Android app which has 2 main screens:

* Show the users current location on a map along with their Elevation in feet.
* Allow the user to search Google Places for 2 points and the Elevation Gain/Loss is displayed.

## Why?

Mainly because I wanted to play with Square's
[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
HTTP asynchronous client library
and [Otto](https://github.com/square/otto) Event Bus.

Also because I was mountain biking recently and wanted
to know my current elevation.
